<h2>About this site</h2>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
This site is <a href='https://github.com/pathawks/pathawks.github.com'>hosted on GitHub</a> and is powered by <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>.

<p>
The theme is free software written by <a href='/'>Pat Hawks</a>. It supports cool things like <a href='http://www.sitemaps.org/'>sitemaps</a>, <a href='http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage'>atom feeds</a>, and is quite extensible. It is freely available under the <a href='http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html'>GNU General Public License</a>, and I would love nothing more than to see you fork it and make it your own.
