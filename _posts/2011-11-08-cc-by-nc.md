Yesterday, Wired announced that [they will be releasing all staff-produced photos](http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2011/11/creative-commons/?pid=1327) under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported license **(CC BY-NC)**](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).

For those unfamiliar, this license allows a third party to reuse one of these photos from Wired, so long as one credits Wired for the photo, and does not use the photo for "commercial purposes".

The particular license they have chosen, raises a very interesting question.
What _is_ a commercial use?

In 2009, [Creative Commons released the results of a study](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127) in which respondents didn't even feel that "personal or private" use was _totally_ noncommercial.

If commercial/noncommercial isn't clearly defined, it seems that the license isn't granting any special rights to _anybody_. If the terms of a Creative Commons license are not met, the use of material is subject to plain vanilla copyright laws.
What's to stop a rights holder from suing a licensee for copyright infringement if their use isn't noncommercial enough? Who gets to decide what that means?

Also of interest is the difference between how the photos are licensed on Wired's website and how the photos are licensed on Flickr.

 *  On their website, [Wired clearly states](http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2011/11/creative-commons/?pid=1327) that the photos are licensed under version **3.0** of the CC BY-NC license. Flickr, however, [states that the photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wiredphotostream/6310062758/in/photostream#photo-sidebar-can-us) are licensed under version **2.0** of the same license.
 *  On their website, Wired asks for a link back to the story in which the photo appeared in addition to the standard attribution. Certainly not an unreasonable request, and totally compatible with their Creative Commons BY-NC license. On Flickr, however, Wired makes no such request and, in fact, _does not even supply the URL_ that the story is from.

If somebody is using a Wired photo and provides a link to Wired's Flickr stream and specifies that the photo was licensed under CC BY-NC **2.0**, rather than linking to the story on Wired and specifying the license as CC BY-NC **3.0**, are they in violation of Wired's terms?

It is worth noting that Flickr does not provide a method for users to license photos with a **3.0** Creative Commons license, which is especially unfortunate as [Creative Commons is now starting work on version **4.0**](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29639)!
